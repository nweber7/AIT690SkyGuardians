AIT 690 Capstone Project: AIRSPACE ICE SUPER SATURATED REGIONS CHARACTERISTICS (ISSRC) AND PREDICTIONS DASHBOARD

Problem Description: Contrails generate 2% of the Earths total anthropogenic global warming. Contrails form from emissions (soot and water vapor) in ice super saturated atmospheric conditions. 
Not a lot of information is known about ISS regions (e.g. size, depth, location, times of day, seasons). A new source of data from NOAA (i.e. IGRA) is available to conduct an analysis. 

Project Goals: Develop a public dashboard to characterize and predict the ISS region for a set of nearby IGRA sensors.
